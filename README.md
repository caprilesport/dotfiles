# Dot files

My dotfiles

I use [yadm](https://yadm.io/docs/install#) to manage them. I once used [this tutorial](https://dev.to/bowmanjd/store-home-directory-config-files-dotfiles-in-git-using-bash-zsh-or-powershell-a-simple-approach-without-a-bare-repo-2if7)
but it turned out to be slow and quite unpractical. 

## Softwares

- [zsh](https://www.zsh.org/)
- [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
- [nvim](https://neovim.io/)
- [helix](https://helix-editor.com/)
- [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)
- [zathura](https://github.com/pwmt/zathura)
- [julia](https://julialang.org/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)
- [tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl)
- [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)

I also leave my fonts here just because it makes life easy.

## Installation

I wanna create some install scripts to ease up the installation of the envinronment in other computers.

For now install the softwares on your own and check my dotfiles for inspiration if you want.
