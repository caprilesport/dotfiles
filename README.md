# Dot files

My dotfiles

I use [yadm](https://yadm.io/docs/install#) to manage them. I once used [this tutorial](https://dev.to/bowmanjd/store-home-directory-config-files-dotfiles-in-git-using-bash-zsh-or-powershell-a-simple-approach-without-a-bare-repo-2if7)
but it turned out to be slow and quite unpractical. 

## Installation

The .config/yadm/bootstrap atteps to install most my software. I blatantly stole it from [@schneiderfelipe](https://github.com/schneiderfelipe/dotfiles/blob/main/up.sh)
dotfiles and adapted it for my use case.
